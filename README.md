### Land Acknowledgement 
London, Ontario is located on the traditional lands of the Anishinaabek, Haudenosaunee, Lūnaapéewak and Attawandaron peoples. This land continues to be home to diverse Indigenous peoples, whom we recognize as contemporary stewards of the land, vital contributors of our society, and deserving of sovereignty and reconciliation.
