                <p>
                    It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or 
                    has a family emergency and we understand it is extremely 
                    disappointing to not have the treatment you requested. 
                    Staff will make every effort in finding an alternative time in 
                    the day or during your stay with another therapist, 
                    sometimes involving a slightly different Treatment. 
                    We appreciate our guests for being so patient during these 
                    unforeseen circumstances. 
                </p>
                <p>Currently if there is a cancellation and you cannot be accommodated, there will be no Spa charge to your room.</p>
                <p>
                    A Free Voucher for a 1 hour (Not RMT) Spa Treatment 
                    will now be provided for your next getaway at 
                    the Couples Resort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Policy change allows us not only to make sure there is no 
                    out of pocket expense (the cost of the treatment) but that we 
                    will also compensate you beyond what the Couples Resort 
                    could not provide you.
                </p>
                <p>Thank You & Enjoy in Our Pleasure,<br><span class="red-body-2">John Sorensen, President.</span></p>
